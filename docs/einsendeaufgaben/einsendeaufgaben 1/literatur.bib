    abstract = {Summary This chapter presents an overview of one-way hash functions including Snefru, N-Hash, MD4, MD5, MD2, secure hash algorithm (SHA), and HAVAL. In the real world, one-way hash functions are built on the idea of a compression function. This one-way function outputs a hash value of length given an input of some larger length. the chapter gives timing measurements for some hash functions. They are meant for comparison purposes only. A message authentication code, or MAC, is a key-dependent one-way hash function. An easy way to turn a one-way hash function into a MAC is to encrypt the hash value with a symmetric algorithm. Any MAC can be turned into a one-way hash function by making the key public.}

The 334 pages of entries offer recommendations to improve the comprehensibility of written material that is generated in the Internet Standards Process (RFC 2026). The recommendations follow the principles that such writing should (a) use the same term or definition whenever the same concept is mentioned; (b) use terms in their plainest, dictionary sense; (c) use terms that are already well-established in open publications; and (d) avoid terms that either favor a particular vendor or favor a particular technology or mechanism over other, competing techniques that already exist or could be developed.
